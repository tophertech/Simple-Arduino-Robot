		<p>While me and my partners still haven't decided what exactly it is we wish to with this project here is what we have so far. We wish to establish a robot that essentailly can navigate itself. After we find out how we will do this I will add more to that project website.</p>

		<t1>Quadrotor</t1>
		<p>A project that I am working on with CSE club members at my school. We have just finished with most of it's physical design and after coming back from a summer we are ready to start programming it. With any luck I will have a link setup shortly once we start with the actual coding.</p>

		<t1>Independent Study at school</t1>
		<p>I have been talking with a porfessor about this and it seems that I will soon be able to start a project that involves sensors(exactly what I want to learn since it involves electronics/hardware). Once I start I will setup a project page for this.</p>
