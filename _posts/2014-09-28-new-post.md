##Slow start

Ok so far we have been up to a slow start however, I hope that as the quarter progresses we will be able to show more progress as the quarter passes. So far we have gotten everything to work as a standalone, but now we need to put everything for the intial part to come together. As time goes on I will add pictures and show any progress maybe post some of the code here. This site is merely an experiment and will be dropped if it becomes too cumbersome.
