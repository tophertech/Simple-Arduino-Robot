	<p>Hello I am currently a computer engineering student at California State University, San Bernardino. When I first heard about the pages feature in github I decided I might give it a go since it sounded like an interesting way to learn a little about web development. Hopefully you enjoy my site. Over the next upcoming months though I hope to get heavily involved in several projects which is the second purpose of this site. I wish to blog about my open source project in my project pages and to use this just as a personal blog. I am also hoping that in this I will be able to look back and see how I went from a beginning engineer to a more experienced one. Anyways I will now be taking my leave and getting started on these tasks.</p>
