	<h2>Created By Eli Gonzalez, Chris Ramirez, and  Jen Rodriguez</h2>
	<p>This project is an attempt to learn about microntrollers including working with what we have. We know that the Arduino is limited and so will need to work with its limitations. For now we are just keeping it simple, but we plan to expand this project heavily to have more than just robot that avoids obstacles.</p>
